# Test Functions for developing
This project aims to provide some commonly used test functions while developing with C++, including:
- TicToc: global timer for speed test, managed with labels

The files and functions in this repository should not be used in projects which are to be released!  
Put the folder TestFuncs to `/usr/local/include` so that you can use the test functions by adding `#include <TestFuncs/...>` to your project.
